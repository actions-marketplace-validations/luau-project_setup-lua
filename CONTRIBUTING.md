## Contributing

### Submitting a pull request

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a new branch for the changes: `git checkout -b my-branch`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Test your changes locally
6. Remove the `dist` files from the list of files to commit

```bash
git restore dist/cli/index.js
git restore dist/github/index.js
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Changes to the files in the `dist` folder generated by the build are not allowed. These files are updated on a new release by the [release branch workflow](.github/workflows/new-release-branch.yml).

7. Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request
8. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed
